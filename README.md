# Predict High-Risk Donors for Hepatitis C
## Predict high-risk donors of HCV using the ‘K-Nearest Neighbors’ model

### Background
* Hepatitis C Virus(HCV) is known to be a ‘transfusion-transmissible infection (TTI)’
* World Health Organization(WHO) recommends all blood donations should be screened for HCV*
* Predicting donors with high risk of Hepatitis C(even before testing HCV) will help blood centers to pre-screen and monitor high-risk donors, enhancing blood safety.
* (Objective) Predict blood donor with a high risk of Hepatitis C

### Project Outline
* Plan Stage: Data collection, Data dictionary, Pre-processing & Feature engineering
* Analyze Stage: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
* Construct Stage: Prepare, Construct, and train & test models
  * Main Model: K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
  * Comparison Model: Logistic Regression
* Execute Stage: Interpret model performance, conclusion
* Platforms used for this project: Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Imbalanced-learn
